Chirp Committee makes it easier to "live tweet" about an event. Say you're at your local city council meeting. You'd like to tweet about what the councilors are saying about your fair city, but it's hard to quickly type and your tweet and tag the councilor in your tweet. Plus, the councilors are all sitting in a semi-circle in front of you, but you can't quite remember all of their names quickly enough.

With Chirp Committee, you can have it automatically remember who's sitting where and automatically include their tag in your tweets.
